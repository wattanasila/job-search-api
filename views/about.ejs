        <p>This web application, built with <strong>Express/Node.js</strong>, connects users with job opportunities by integrating the <strong>Adzuna API</strong>. It allows users to search for jobs based on location and filters, view job listings, and manage their own locally stored job postings. The application prioritizes simplicity and usability, utilizing <strong>EJS</strong> for dynamic content rendering and <strong>Axios</strong> for seamless API communication.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Job Listings:</strong> Browse job advertisements sourced from the Adzuna API based on location and filters.</li>
    <li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> Search for job listings by location and other filters (note: direct title-based search for Adzuna jobs is not supported).</li>
    <li><strong>Local Job Postings:</strong> Create, edit, and delete personal job postings that are stored locally and fully searchable by title.</li>
    <li><strong>Employment Insights:</strong> Access trends in salaries and vacancies to better understand the job market.</li>
    </ul>
        <p>Designed to provide a smooth and user-friendly experience, this project showcases the integration of external APIs, server-side programming, and responsive design. It enables users to interact with job data in real time, leveraging the power of <strong>Express/Node.js</strong> and <strong>API-driven development</strong>.</p>
